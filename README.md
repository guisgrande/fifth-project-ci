## UX/UI Design

During the elaboration of the project, the aspects for the final result to respect a good UX (User experience) and UI (User interface) behavior were taken into consideration, thus delivering a quality project where the user can follow the steps of a purchase without difficulties or complications.

### Strategy

#### Site owner goals

As mentioned, the project is an e-commerce project. I chose as the main product to be commercialized in the online store the skateboard with the theme of using real street art (graffiti) as design. To complement the product options were also added hats and bags. The business model is B2C where our target audience are direct consumers.

The idea for marketing and promotion would be the presence in social networks targeting the topics of skateboarding, graffiti, hip hop / rap community and other street sports. With a well designed SEO for the website and that transmits confidence and transparency to users, I believe it would be a project with potential for success.

  - The Street Craft e-commerce store aims to be responsive on multiple devices to reach and be available to as many people as possible.
  - Be practical to register and access the account/profile for users who wish to do so.
  - So that users can easily add products to their bag and also modify it with convenience.
  - That users can view offers and discounted prices.
  - That the online store has a practical and simple checkout, requesting only the most important information to finish the order safely.
  - That the website provides feedback on important user actions, such as messages informing when logged in, logged out, when the order was completed, or at other relevant times.
  - That users can review their information when necessary, like delivery details, order details or status.

#### Agile
